Data Structure and Algorithms Coursework in C++ and Java


## Included Projects

+ Percolation: a Java implementation of the union-find algorithm to represent a percolation model.
+ Queues: a standard Java implementation of a FIFO queue algorithm.
+ String: a standard C++ implementation of a string class with common behaviors.
+ Hashes: a C++ implementation of Symbol Tables hash algorithm.
+ Linked List: a C++ implementation of Dynamically Linked Lists.
+ Quicksort: a standard C++ implementation of quicksort (I enjoyed mergesort more, personally).

More examples or variations on these implementations (e.g., in Python), see my [gists](https://gist.github.com/bryangoodrich)


### Background

I took lower division classes at American River College doing data structures in both C++ and Java. I also took a number of data structure courses at Coursera and Udacity. These were codebases I felt worth keeping around for one reason or another. 

For some odd reason my definitely-not-A-grade String class was my most popular repo. I thank those that have responded to it over the last decade to tell me about memory leaks and how to handle them. It most likely falls on deaf ears, because I am not a C++ programmer! I may get into Rust, though.
