Data Structure and Algorithms Coursework in C++ and Java

### Background

I took lower division classes at American River College doing data structures in both C++ and Java. I also took a number of data structure courses at Coursera and Udacity. These were codebases I felt worth keeping around for one reason or another. 

For some odd reason my definitely-not-A-grade String class was my most popular repo. I thank those that have responded to it over the last decade to tell me about memory leaks and how to handle them. It most likely falls on deaf ears, because I am not a C++ programmer! I may get into Rust, though.
